# PySpark_Recommendation
Simple recommendation of movie-user data via PySpark

This project is for self teaching purposes for PySpark (Apache Spark, but also Databricks). 

### Goal
Using the MovieLens Dataset, we predict the movie ratings of users. 

### The How
We preprocess the dataframe using PySpark and apply simple Machine Learning algorithms to the data. 

We use Linear Regression as a naive approach and collaborative filtering (here known as ALS) as standard approach.
